= ActivityCounter

This plugin creates a table with cache counter for diferent status of models

It gets a source model(supose user) and a cached model(supose intiviation to events)

  A user is invited to an event
  User -> Invitation -> Event

  How many users have/are (status)
  Event => invitations
    Invitations has a status
      accepted
      rejected
      maybe
      pending
  
  
  
There are two default counters:
  all: counts all elements
  new: counts new before some "status" field is updated
  
== Custom counters by convention
  
  The counted model, the belongs to one, should have a status field (it can be specified if called different) that can be compared when is updated
  or the current status can be seen to decrease the counter before it's destroyed.
  
  For this purpose three methods are created for every status:
  
    *#{counter_name}.to?*
      When the status change to counter status (increase)
    *#{counter_name}.from?*
      When the status moves from another counter status (decrease)
    *#{counter_name}?*
      When the row is being destroyed ask if this is the current status (decrease)

    New invitation
      invitation.status.pending.to? true (pending counter is increased)
      invitation.status.pending.from? false
    
    User updates his status to accepted
      invitation.status.pending.to? false
      invitation.status.pending.from? true (pending counter is decreased)
      invitation.status.accepted.to? true (accepted counter is increased)
      
  *Example:
  
    @event.invitations.count_on :new
    @event.invitations.count_on :accepted

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :events
    has_many :invitations, :dependent => :destroy
    
  end
  
  class Invitation < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :event, :counter_cache => {:defaults => true} # Will count :new items and :all
    
    # This method will create a pending, pending?, to_pending?, from_pending? for every key
    # it will only count the total( :all ) of rows if you want it to count :new just set defaults => true
    belongs_to :user, :counter_cache => {:defaults => :all, :pending => 1, :accepted => 2, :rejected => 3, :maybe => 4 }
    
  end
  
== Default :counter_cache's
   
   :new
      increase => it is being increased when a new item is created
      decrease => when this item is updated, the counter will decrease it
   :all
      increase => it is being increased when a new item is created
      decrease => it is being decreased when an item is destroyed
  
===Â Custom :counter_cache's
  
   When an item is being updated the counter will be increased/decreased depending on
   if #{counter}.to? is true (increased) or if #{counter}.from? is true (decreased).
  
   The updated row must have a "status" field containing the different stats of it.
   If your model hasn't a field named "status" exactly, it can be customized by passing 
   :status_field => 'my_status_field_name' parameter to the belongs_to method
